/** \mainpage Introduction
  PCU (Parallel Control Utility) is a library for parallel computation based on
  MPI with additional support for hybrid MPI/thread environments.
  PCU provides three things to users:
    1. A hybrid phased message passing system
    2. Hybrid collective operations
    3. A thread management system

  Phased message passing is similar to Bulk Synchronous Parallel.
  All messages are exchanged in a phase, which is a collective over
  all threads in the parallel program.
  During a phase, the following events happen in sequence:
    1. All threads send non-blocking messages to other threads
    2. All threads receive all messages sent to them during this phase
  PCU provides termination detection, which is the ability to detect when all
  messages have been received without prior knowledge of
  which threads are sending to which.

  To write hybrid MPI/thread programs, PCU provides a function that creates
  threads within an MPI process, similar to the way
  mpirun creates multiple processes.
  PCU assigns ranks to these threads and has them each run the same function,
  with thread-specific input arguments to the function.

  Once a program has created threads using PCU, it can call the message passing
  API from within threads, which behaves as if each thread were an MPI rank.
  Threads have unique ranks and can send messages to one another,
  regardless of which process they are in.
